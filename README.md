# Noemdek Assessment Task A

This repository contains the code for Noemdek Assessment Task A, developed by Teyi Adzufeh.

## Description

It includes building a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, with features such as user authentication, data validation, and database integration.

## Database choice explanation

Due to the relational, and dependent nature of data in this project, I decided to make use of Postgresql, a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that supports SQL. This helped to perform DB queries with ease and reduced redundancy in the process.
